# Shanghai Floating Life Chronicles

This project is inspired by the "Beijing Floating Life Chronicles" from several years ago and is part of our group’s C++ course design assignment.

In this game, players need to engage in buying and selling trades within a 40-day period, using sharp judgment to maximize their profits.

You can download the release version, unzip it, and open the shanghaifusheng.exe to play the game. On the main game screen (the one with the item inventory), you can check the base prices of goods by going to the top menu bar: Help → Help Manual. This will help you decide whether it's a good time to buy or sell.

We wish you the best of luck in reaching the top of the leaderboard!

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us through the issues section or via the contact information provided in the "Contact Us" section.  

# 上海浮生记

本项目的思路仿照多年前的《北京浮生记》，是我们小组的C++课程的课程设计  

玩家需要在**40**天的时间内进行买卖交易，通过精湛的判断来使自己的收益尽可能高  

可以通过下载发行版，解压后打开其中的**shanghaifusheng.exe**进行游戏

您可以在游戏主页面（也就是具有商品背包栏的页面）中上方菜单栏-帮助-帮助手册中查看商品的基准价格，以此来决定您这次是否适合买入或卖出  

预祝您登顶排行榜！
